# Recruitment and Cohesion in EVE Online

## Overview
Project seeks to first isolate corporation recruitment patterns in EVE by locating when individuals are being targeted and vetted. The goal is to build a metric of how selective a group is vis-a-vis another group, and to track the diversity of selection methods groups employ when choosing a recruit.

From there, the project looks to map coordination networks within corporations to generate a measure of group cohesion. The goal is to identify and measure task and social cohesion within participatory groups online.

Finally, the project will examine the correlation between recruitment processes and group cohesion over time to determine if there is an association between _who_ is let in and how the group functions as a unit.

## Auxiliary Targets

- Examine the association between group size and cohesion. Are there patterns or trends that are ubiquitous across groups of a certain size? That is, groups of a certain size may be required to delegate and formalize.  


## Renewed Focus on Alliances
Qualitatively, alliance is where the story is at. The goal is to examine the selectivity of alliances and the groups that compose them, focusing on NULL space alliances that must mobilize when their territory is being attacked.

Questions: 
- Does selection predict mobilization (that is, individuals coming online and defending territory when it is challenged)?
- Does selection predict how groups work together? Is there mixing of different groups or do groups remain factional?
- How are resources shared in an alliance? Does a more stringent selection process make alliances more willing to pool resources?
